📊 Store Sales Analysis

Business Analytics Internship – Skillfied Mentor

---

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing store-level data to understand how macro-economic indicators, holiday periods, and promotional markdowns behave over time.
In the absence of direct sales or revenue data, the analysis emphasizes patterns, volatility, and relationships that influence retail performance.

The project combines Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Power BI storytelling dashboards, demonstrating analytical thinking beyond traditional sales-only metrics.

---

🎯 Business Objective

To support data-driven decision-making by:

Understanding the behavior of economic indicators (Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment)

Comparing holiday vs non-holiday periods

Evaluating promotion intensity and timing using markdown data

Identifying patterns that can inform pricing, promotion strategy, and risk awareness

Business insight ≠ only sales.
Macro indicators and promotions provide critical operational context.
